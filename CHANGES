1.0.0   2011-12-01

    [ FEATURE ]
    * Use overload to auto stringify the object to the rfc2307 representation
      This removes the need for the ugly { return_object => 1 } argument
      The { return_object => 1 } syntax is removed with immediate effect
      If you used the { return_object => 1 } syntax, it will no longer
      This is a backwards incompatible change.
